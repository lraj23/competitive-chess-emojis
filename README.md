# Competitive Chess Emojis

### Main Purpose

The point of this bot is to analyze your conversations (though as of now, just each individual message) and react with an appropriate chess emoji for each message (brilliant, great, best, excellent, good, book, inaccuracy, mistake, missed win, blunder). Then, you earn coins and go up the leaderboard, also using your coins for other things (not yet but maybe?). To do this, it uses an AI from OpenRouter (specifically openai/gpt-oss-20b).

### Commands

Since this bot sends all of your messages to an AI, and a lot of people probably don't like that, especially without consent or being notified, you can only get play the game if you opt in.

#### To Be Added
This command opts you in to something.
